# Comparison of the results from web UI, curl (cmd) and Excel add-in

This article was written because of great interest among QA staff and Route4Me users about compability between the results from defferent applications:
- web UI. Results of route optimization on the official website: http://www.route4me.com;
- curl (cmd). Results of route optimization using curl (cmd);
- Excel add-in. Results of route optimizatin using Excel add-in.

For the aplications we prepared input data with similar content:

### Excel add-in

Response JSON file - [Excel add-in Single Driver Multiple TW ](https://github.com/route4me/route4me-curl/blob/master/QA%20Related/Applications%20results%20compability/SD_multiple_TW_Excel_RESPONSE.json)

### Conclusion

The results from **curl (cmd)** and **Excel add-in** are **equal**. Ther result from **web UI** is **same** but movement on the route is **opposite**.
***

## 2. Multiple Driver Multiple Time Windows With Vehicle Capacity = 1

For this optimization type was changed only the parameter **algorithm_type**:
```
algorithm_type=3
```

The addresses are same as in the previous optimization type.

## Results

### web UI

In case of web UI we got 1 route.

Response JSON file - [web UI Multiple Driver Multiple TW ](https://github.com/route4me/route4me-curl/blob/master/QA%20Related/Applications%20results%20compability/MD_multiple_TW_cap_1_web_UI_RESPONSE.json)

The route one the map.

### curl (cmd)

Was got 10 routes - from depot to other stops one by one.

Response JSON file - [curl (cmd) Multiple Driver Multiple TW, Vehicle Capacity = 1 ](https://github.com/route4me/route4me-curl/blob/master/QA%20Related/Applications%20results%20compability/MD_multiple_TW_cap_1_curl_RESPONSE.json)

### Excel add-in

Was got 10 routes - from depot to other stops one by one.

Response JSON file - [Excel add-in Multiple Driver Multiple TW, Vehicle Capacity = 1 ](https://github.com/route4me/route4me-curl/blob/master/QA%20Related/Applications%20results%20compability/MD_multiple_TW_cap_1_Excel_RESPONSE.json)

### Conclusion

The results from the **curl (cmd)** and **Excel add-in** are equal again. The **web UI** result is different - it seems low value of the parameter **vehicle_capacity** didn't affected on the result - altough, in the response file we see that 
```
vehicle_capacity=1
```
***

## 3. Multiple Driver Multiple Time Windows With Vehicle Capacity = 30

The parameters and addresses are same except the parameter **vehicle_capacity**
```
vehicle_capacity=30
```

## Results

### web UI

Results from web UI is same as vehicle_capacity=1

Response JSON file - [web UI Single Driver Multiple TW, Vehicle Capacity = 30 ](https://github.com/route4me/route4me-curl/blob/master/QA%20Related/Applications%20results%20compability/MD_multiple_TW_cap_30_web_UI_RESPONSE.json)

The route one the map.

The route one the map.

The route one the map.

### Conclusion

The results from **curl (cmd)** and **Excel add-in** are **equal**. Ther route shape from **web UI** is **same**, but the sequence of the addresses is different.
***

## Summary

The name for the value 3 of parameter **algorithm** is CVRP_TW_SD - **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem, Time Windows, Single Depot**. Of course, this algorithm assumes that we should pay attention to the parameter **vehicle_capacity** and set it to right value. If we'll set it to 1, algorithm will be forced to generate almost as many routes as many stops are in the optimization.

## Apendix

Please, pay attention to this table, which shows corespodence between API parameters and web UI field names.

| web UI field | API parameter |
|:-----------|:------------|
| Maximum Pieces per Route | vehicle_capacity |
|Maximum Weight per Vehicle|vehicle_max_cargo_weight|
|Maximum Volume per Route|vehicle_max_cargo_volume|
|Maximum Distance per Vehicle or Route|vehicle_max_distance_mi|
|Maximum Number of Routes/Vehicles|parts|
|Maximum Stops per Route|max_tour_size|
