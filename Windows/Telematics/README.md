# Telematics Gateway

The Route4Me telematics gateway allows you to integrate data from third party telematics systems through the "Vehicles" section of your Route4Me account. Vehicles from connected third-party systems are automatically imported and re-synchronized into the account of the corresponding Route4Me user. Each Route4Me vehicle can then be "linked" to a vehicle that is external to Route4Me.

When tracking data is captured from a 3rd party system, then data sent to Route4Me is evaluated to determine which vehicle (by ID) is associated with this connected vehicle ID. The last-known active route for the corresponding Route4Me vehicle ID is identified, and tracking data is appended into this route's tracking history.
